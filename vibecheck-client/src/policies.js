                        <Header as="h2">The Sentiment Score</Header>
                        <p>
                            At times, the sentiment score may seem to return
                            strange or annoyingly-neutral results. This is
                            normal; we're taking into account any comment that
                            the tool finds during processing, so a plethora of
                            negative sentiment may end up canceled out by a
                            plethora of positive sentiment, leaving you with a
                            fairly neutral score. Additionally, you may find
                            that the score and results change between multiple
                            searches of the same query, even within a few
                            minutes of each other. This is also normal; the
                            primary cause of this variance are the interfaces
                            (APIs) we're using to gather data from platforms. A
                            search of a term on a certain platform will often
                            yield differing results due to a variety of
                            limitations present in the API that allows us to
                            obtain this data, so the same search may lead to the
                            analysis of different datasets.

                            required to keep this site working as intended. Each
                            search and its results are recorded; however, no
                            personally identifying nformation is associated with
                            any of these searches. Furthermore, we collect no
                            personally identifying information upon any other
                            action taken on the site, nor do we use cookies. In
                            other words, only the information about the search
                            itself is saved; not a byte is spent logging any
                            information about who you are because that's not our
                            business.
